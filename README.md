# Minigame Jam Framework
The goal of this project is for game jam teams to create 4-player minigames that are then compiled into a Mario Party style game.
[WPI IGDA Party](https://igda-wpi.itch.io/wpi-igda-party) is the product of over a dozen game jam entries across many years all compiled into one party game catalogue.

Learn how to use this framework with the [User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t7A7M-wwTv02umcZk_as4Ys-McbW0ucQ4ZoooDDnxKY/edit?usp=sharing)

Do not edit any Project Settings. This includes **_tags_**, **_layers_**, and **_gravity_**. Modifying these settings can interfere with other minigames. Get creative with the provided settings.
